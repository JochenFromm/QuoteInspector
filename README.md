# QuoteInspector

Simple Angular app for investigating quotes of wise men, old philosophers and great minds.

See live on [GitHub Pages](https://jochenfromm.github.io/QuoteInspector/) or on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/JochenFromm/QuoteInspector).

This project uses currently Angular 10.2.1 and was originally generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

The Quotes itself can be found in the assets directory [here](https://github.com/JochenFromm/QuoteInspector/blob/master/src/assets/quotes.txt)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--configuration=production` flag for a production build. Deploy to GitHub pages with

```
git checkout gh-pages
git merge master
ng build quote-inspector --configuration=production --base-href=https://jochenfromm.github.io/QuoteInspector/
ngh
```

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
